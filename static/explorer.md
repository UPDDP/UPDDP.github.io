## **Solution Graph Explorer**

We propose to conceptualize the relationships among requirements, data, and solutions within a visual analytics paper as a knowledge graph.  We introduce the concept of a **<u>solution path</u>** A), which represents a path from a requirement node to a solution node with zero outdegree. This encapsulates atomic problem-solving knowledge within a VA paper, illustrated here with the example of *Facetto* B).

We aggregated the solution paths from diverse visual analytics papers into a directed and weighted **<u>solution graph</u>**, where problem-driven design patterns manifest as interconnected paths or subgraphs. You can filter the underlying solution paths by *<u>clicking</u>* the nodes in the graph. *<u>Tooltips</u>* would emerge when hovering on nodes or edges.
