This website presents our study on problem-driven design patterns in visual analytics. Drawing inspiration from the idea of formalizing best practices to solve common problems when designing systems in software engineering domain, we aim to aggregate scattered problem-solving knowledge in VA research for both researchers and readers to consider. 

The **Explorer** page presents an interactive force-directed solution graph derived from the coding of 220 qualified visual analytics papers. You are empowered to interactively filter the nodes of requirements, data, and solutions, as well as examine the corresponding patterns of solution paths.

The **Typologies** page presents our refined typologies for requirement, data, and solution in visual analytics. We introduce a new Functional part of requirement typology, a new Data Manipulation part of solution typology, and incorporate data typologies of Munzer and Bigelow et al.

The **Research Corpus** page presents the corpus containing 220 visual analytics paper published on IEEE TVCG and IEEE VAST. We detached these publications into units of requirements, data, and solutions. Then we coded these units using the aforementioned typologies and organized them into solution paths.
