The A) Analytical requirement is adopted from Lam et al.'s Analysis Goals Framework. We extended it with a B) Functional part, resembling the functional and non-functional taxonomy in the software engineering domain.

- ***Interactivity*** requires enhanced interactions on the system interface. For example, SkyLens requires to “*support an interactive exploration and refinement of skyline*”.
- ***Knowledge Injection*** involves incorporating human knowledge into the system to facilitate the analytical process. For example, VATLD requires to “*inject human intelligence for performance improvement with minimal human interaction*”.
- ***Sharing Findings*** requires aggregating information relating to the findings for subsequent sharing. For example, MotionFlow requires to “*generate pattern analysis results in a form so that findings and insights can be shared with other researchers and domains*”.
- ***Data Filtering*** enables the analytical process to concentrate on a specific part of the data. For example, LegalVis  requires to “*allow filtering decisions by justice rapporteur, by decision type, and by type of citation (explicit or potential)*”.
- ***Ensuring Data Quality*** involves managing data quality during the analytical process. For example, Müller-Sielaff et al.  were required to “*assess the dataset’s representativeness, e.g., distribution, and identify biases in the data at an early stage*”.
- ***Modeling & Enhancement*** involves establishing models for domain tasks and bringing desired improvements to the model. For example, MutualDetector requires to “combine captions and annotations to train an object detector” and “mutually improve the performance of the label extractor and object detector”.
- ***Flexibility & Scalability*** demand the system to adapt to varying data volume and structure. For example, MoNetExplorer requires to “*select the appropriate window size for the analysis of dynamic network data*”.
